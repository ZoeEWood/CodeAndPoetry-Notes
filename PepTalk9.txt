Tomorrow — secure drop tutorial
	-how do you give a lot of information to a journalist w/o giving away your identity 
	-there is a need to have more secure drops in the US — right now most secure drops are on 	the west coast. 
	-the bare minimum is unix system administration, a few other things. 
	-everything for the class due the 13th (Saturday at midnight)
		-paper is due on the 19th 
	-‘you’re creating a package of what you’ve done in this class’ 
	-infrastructure as a service 
-the server facilities are often housed in underground bunkers that can withstand direct nuclear attack b/c much of our national security infrastructure is run from these facilities
-a server is a box and then inside, some of the parts are connected. S3 and elastic block are connected, for example 
-a few network command line tools: 
-ping
	-latency: how long it takes you to get a response back 
	-if you’re able to ping in through terminal it means that your computer is okay
-remember the general architecture 
-traceroute
	-shows you everywhere the information has travelled 
	-who is cogentco.com? this is where it goes after Columbia
	-From Website: 
	Net Neutrality
	Cogent practices net neutrality. We do not prioritize packet transmissions on the basis of the content of the packet, 
	the customer or network that is the source of the packet, or the customer or network that is the recipient of the packet. 
	Where there are network problems such as congestion at interconnection points or fiber cuts we implement network management 
	tools to minimize harm to the users of our network.
	It is Cogent's belief that both the customer and the Internet as a whole are best served if the application layer remains independent from the network. Innovation in the development of new applications is fueled by the individual's ability to reach as many people as possible without regard to complicated gating factors such as tiered pricing or bandwidth structures used by legacy service providers.
Applications proliferate in a free market economy which is the Internet today.
-ssh: session based protocol -- you're not going to just send packets in a random way but will establish a connection with a particular port 
	-all the traffic between A and B will be secured.
	-if you're in china and twitter is blocked, but columbia is not, you can request information from columbia and get it through your tunnel
	-'walking around and leaving behind us little servers' = our duty as free citizens 
	-all the traffic will look, to whoever is monitoring it, like nothing
	-parenthetical: we are not doing computing in an empowered way
		-when somebody prevents you from talking in the town square, you know what that looks like. but to recognize the equivalent online requires a certain amount of literacy 
		-when somebody tries to infringe of the political rights of our children, we want them to be able to use ssh without a second thought
		-how does this freedom manifest itself literally, in these networks
		-had all of these technologies existed a long time ago when philosophers were trying to right about free speach and liberty, all the problems of abstraction would be a lot less difficult because even abstract topics like liberty would have had a physical layer in digitial infrastructure
-keys are a very important concept -- keys have to be secure
	-idea for final tutorial: pgp key based on tutorial that edward snowden sent to glenn greenwald
