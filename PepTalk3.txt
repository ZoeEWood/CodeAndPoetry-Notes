in prep for this section, run these commands in terminal: 

brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew install coreutils
brew install findutils --default-names
brew install gnu-indent --default-names
brew install gnu-sed --default-names
brew install gnutls --default-names
brew install grep --default-names

-now, (if you're working with an Apple computer) you have the capacity to download really useful tools that Apple doesn't have! 

NOW, 
-put Mobdy Dick in your directory
-remember find, head and tail
-now, try grep
	grep "string you're searching" file 
-want to count how many times the word whale is used in moby dick? 
	grep "whale" pg2701 | wc
	1237 15107 87622
	-lines, words characters. 
	so Cool!

	here, you are "piping." that's the "|" symbol

-sort pg2701.txt | uniq -c 
	-this will find how many unique lines there are in the piece and list them in alphabetical order, say how many of each exists 


Challenge #1
-analyze the treatment of gender in moby dick
	-create a new directory
	-save moby dick in direcoty
	-make file called male, write in it some words that have to do with being male
	-make another directory called female.txt, and do the same thing as above. 
	-then, grep all the famale words, and grep all the female words 
	-make two moby dicks, one with female words, one with male words
	-then, get rid of all the common words (i.e. the and oh)

Challenge #2: Weasel words
-take a piece of writing that you wrote and check for clarity of writing
copy 3 pieces of your own writing, then convert into plaintext
-make a file of weasel words (you can look this up on the internet)
-now, write a script that replaces those weasel words with " " or something else
	-(only choose 3 weasel words)


-want to search for engineer, tick and dog 
-grep -wf test.txt mobdydick.txt

-tokenizing: 
	-we now need to break these up into words
	-we now have to take each line and separate it into words
	-command is sed (a line based substitution engine) '\s/\n/g' (substitute a space with a newline)  moby-dick.txt 
		-this is the sed fence !!!
