-you're already ahead of the curve, just by knowing ls, pwd etc. 
-install something called brew
	-a concept that is very powerful, coming from the Linux world
-macs don't come with basic tools such as wget, i.e., wget: once you've downloaded brew, you can say wget and it's all of a sudden in your central repository
	-if you do brew install -vd wget, you will actually have wget on your computer
	-then, try "man wget" and your computer will tell you how to use wget. this proves that it is there on your computer !!

-anyway, now we're moving to a slightly more advanced level 
-now, we're going to use all the really fun, powerful search tools 
-we'll learn cat, head, tail, and we'll continue to explore files 
-when we're talking about files, what do we mean by extension? 
	-make a new directory called pdfs
	-go online, copy the url of a pdf you like
	-go into your pdfs folder, and run wget [URL]
	-ls, and you should see it in your folder!

-now practice head and tail
	-head [file.pdf] should yield the first few lines
	-tail [file.pdf] should yield the last few lines

-locate: a good way to find files. just to find files. 
	-c: will give you the number of files with the pattern
