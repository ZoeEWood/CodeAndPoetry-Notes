-Github is the most widely used application that allows for collaboration on a project. 
Picture a vector with a lot of vectors coming out of it that, once begun, remain 
parallel to the original vector. The original vector is the 'master,' and the secondary
vectors are 'branches.' These branches most often represent various collaborators, 
and these collaborators can merge their edits with the 'master' by issuing a 'pull request.'
-of course, there must be an administrator who controls the master -- it is this administrator 
who approves or declines pull requests. 
-most companies with a huge software base have their own, proprietary versions of github   
Here is how make a new repository in git, from terminal: 
	-create a directory: mkdir NewDirectory
	-put a file in that directory: touch newFile
	-initialize your new directory as a git repository: git init (run this from 
	inside the directory
	-add the new file to the directory, which is not a git repository
	-commit the file, with a message that briefly explain what changes you made
	to the file: git commit -m "added a new file called 'newFile'"
	-establish connection between the directory that you just initalized on you 
	local computer as a repository that is recognized by git's servers: 
	git remote add origin: https://github.com/YourName/NewDirectory.git
	-push the changes you made to this newly-remote directory: git push -u origin master 
-if two people are working on the same paragraph at the same time, with equal access privileges, 
things will go wrong
-to avoid this you need to use branching
-branching: entirely dependent on the sources being in md or plaintext -- any format where what you see is 
really what you get. 
-github will render most of your semantic markup. as such you can use it as a personal wiki or sorts. 
-Here is the assignment:
	-open a new respository called lab notes
	-push your existing notes to that repository 
	-make sure it's organized and in plaintext. 
	(this respository is the result of this assignment)
-say you want to include images in your repository -- you would not want to have images in a separate branch, 
rather, you would want a whole new images folder.
