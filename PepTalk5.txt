Turing machines: 
-the negation machine -- the tape is forever, it will negate for forever
-affirmation machine -- the tape is forever, A=A over and over again
-universal machine -- can take a whole machine as an input (can take on the property of any other Turing machine, and this is what makes it universal)
	-does this mean that it can take two inputs -- the data and the operation? as opposed to just the data? 
	-what is hardware and software here? it seems like it's kind able to rewrite its own hardware

Turing's paper: 
-computable vs. effectively computable 
-you can compare this to a man computing real numbers 
-this paper was incredibly influential on cognitive science 
-machine that is aware -- there is so much allure here and this becomes very influential in artificial intelligence
-machine can, in altering its configuration, remember some of the previous internal states
-possible state is determine by the m configuraton AND the scan symbol. the configuration determines the behavior of a machine
-you have to sleep on it and use your imagination a bit
-it's a machine that can reconfigure its internal states
-your state of mind, only kind of formalized

How does the author define the state of the machine? 
^^

What is the equivalent of of software here? 
-the tape?
-it's not so easy to get what is software and what is hardware
-the symbol seems to be abstractable -- more "softwareish" 
-in the sense that anything can be reduced to the basic logic that's on the tape, I think that's 
-it's very curious to me the distance between data and program
-whatever data is physically in front of you (if you're cooking an omelet, the omelet is your state) is part of your state 
-looking for a way to simply understand how booting a computer happens 

-if you can reduce a field to a set of symbols, and reduce the abilities of a tractor to a set of symbols, maybe a tractor is a Turing machine (???)
